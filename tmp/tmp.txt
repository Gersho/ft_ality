We will be using ocaml 4.14.1

opam switch create 4.14.1
some stuff might be marked deprecated in preparation to OCAML5
-> need to watch out for compilation warnings

You are allowed to use the following modules:
◦ Pervasives
    The initially opened module.

    This module provides the basic operations over the built-in types
    (numbers, booleans, byte sequences, strings, exceptions, references,
    lists, arrays, input-output channels, ...).

    This module is automatically opened at the beginning of each compilation.
    All components of this module can therefore be referred by their short name,
    without prefixing them by Pervasives.

◦ List
    Some functions are flagged as not tail-recursive. 
    The above considerations can usually be ignored
    if your lists are not longer than about 10000 elements.

◦ String
    strings are always immutable

     OCaml strings used to be modifiable in place,
     for instance via the String.set and String.blit functions described below.
     This usage is deprecated and only possible when the compiler
     is put in "unsafe-string" mode by giving the -unsafe-string command-line option
     (which is currently the default for reasons of backward compatibility).
     This is done by making the types string and bytes (see module Bytes) interchangeable
     so that functions expecting byte sequences can also accept strings as arguments and modify them.

!!! All new code should avoid this feature and be compiled with the -safe-string command-line option
    to enforce the separation between the types string and bytes.

◦ Sys
    Every function in this module raises Sys_error
    with an informative message when the underlying system call signal an error.

◦ Sdl
    This module contains functions for initializing/quitting the library 
◦ Sdlevent
◦ Sdlkey

ocamlsdl has system dep libsdl1.2-dev
