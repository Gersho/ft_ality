You are allowed to use the following modules:
◦ Pervasives
!!! Deprecated in ocaml5, replaced by Stdlib
    https://v2.ocaml.org/api/Stdlib.html

    The OCaml Standard library.
    This module is automatically opened at the beginning of each compilation.
    All components of this module can therefore be referred by their short name,
    without prefixing them by Stdlib.

    In particular, it provides the basic operations over the built-in types
    (numbers, booleans, byte sequences, strings, exceptions, references,
    lists, arrays, input-output channels, ...) and the standard library modules.

◦ List
    Some functions are flagged as not tail-recursive. 

◦ String
    strings are always immutable

◦ Sys
    Every function in this module raises Sys_error
    with an informative message when the underlying system call signal an error.
