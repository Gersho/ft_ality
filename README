		grammar file syntax
###################################

leading/trailing whitespace are ignored
empty lines are ignored
section names start with a @
2 sections, @keyconfig and @movelist
each section is required
@keyconfig should be the first section
(action used in @movelist must be previously declared in @keyconfig)
lines before the first section are printed but ignored

	@keyconfig:
		symbol ":" is reserved and cannot be used as a key nor as part of an action
		<key>:<action>
		key and action are separated by symbol :

		one <key>:<action> pair per line
		section must have at least 1 <key>:<action> pair
		a key cannot be repeated
		an action can be repeated

		<key> reserved by system cannot be used (such as media keys, super, printscreen)
		<key> naming is based on (keycode)_to_string from sdlkeycode.ml
			-> numeric keypad keys must be prefaced by KP_ such as
				KP_2
				KP_Minus
			-> single letters must be upper-case
			-> numbers from the character keys must be prefaced by Num such as
				Num2
				Num9

		exemple:
		a:kick
		k:HK
		l:LP
		KP_2:2
		KP_3:3
		KP_6:6
		q:LP
		w:MP
		e:HP

	@movelist:
		<action>-<action>-<action>:<move>
		actions are separated by -
		actions and move are separated by :
		- and : are reserved for action (but can be used for move name)

		section must have at least 1 <action>:<move> pair
		the same full action sequence cannot be repeated
		
		exemple:
		2-3-6-LP:Hadouken
